# ProjectEuler
My programmed solutions to problems on Project Euler

I started this a while back which is why there's a seperate Python2 folder.
Also this means some of the early solutions have horrendous naming conventions.

Some programs have versions, these are usually because I wanted to attempt a problem from a completely different perspective (and only the latest version is the one that works).

From now on will be uploading new solutions commented and with better naming conventions when I do more problems.
